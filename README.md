# vsxexport
Bash script for exporting Gaia configuration of VS0 as well as all other Virtual Sytems (settings like BGP config, routemaps etc.). It also saves the current routing info, useful for diff checks during maintenance windows. Configuration files like local.arp and fwkern.conf, simkern.conf (see sk101515) are also exported.
